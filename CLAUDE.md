# User Preferences

## Dev Server
- Never start local dev servers automatically
- If a dev server is needed but not running, provide the command to run instead of launching it

## Shell
- Prefer `jq` over `python3` for JSON parsing in shell commands

## Communication
- Be direct and concise — skip preamble
- Don't explain code changes unless asked
